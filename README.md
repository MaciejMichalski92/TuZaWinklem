This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

to make a new component automatically, run the command:

```bash
npm run component <file(atoms||molecules||organisms||layouts)> <componentName>
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Caveats and tips

- **For using Layout with dynamic components based on UserAgent device:**

```js
export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async ({
  req: { headers }
}) => {
  const { device, isBot } = getDeviceInfoFromClient(headers);

  return {
    props: {
      device,
      isBot
    }
  };
};
```
